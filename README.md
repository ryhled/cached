The light-weight, fast, concurrency-safe and unobtrusive cache library for Net Core / Net 5. 

#### What is Cached?

The goal of Cached is to be a thin, fast, wrapper around existing, official, cache libraries (Like MemoryCache and DistributedCache).

Cached wraps these libraries and makes them concurrency-safe, **with a minimal amount of locking**. It also provides flexibility and ease-of-use.

#### Why use Cached?

- Cached wraps your methods and caches it for you automatically, without risk of cache stampedes.
- It does not prevent, or hide, official cache provider configuration, standard methods still applies.
- Cached only applies locking as it is required to prevent stampedes (no global locks). 
- Cached offers flexibility and ease-of-use.
- Cached is thin. No need to create dependencies on huge caching frameworks.

## Getting started

To show the absolute most basic implementation, suitable for a console app for example, this is what is required:

1. Add the nuget package for InMemory caching.
```
nuget install Cached.InMemory
```

2. Create a default instance and fetch data.

```
var cacher = MemoryCacher.Default();
var value = await cacher.GetOrFetchAsync("key", key => service.GetData(key));
```

The 'service.GetData' calls is where you place your asynchronous service that fetches the actual data (may it be from database, REST/SOAP service or which ever).

### Adding cached to a net core application

Startup.cs

```
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCached(options => options.AddInMemoryCaching());
}
```

Razor page

```
private readonly IInMemoryCacher _cacher;

public IndexModel(IInMemoryCacher cacher)
{
    _cached = cached;
}

public async Task OnGet()
{
    var value = await _cacher.GetOrFetchAsync("key", async key => { ... });
}
```

**More examples and information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/ryhled/cached/wiki) and in the [demo](https://github.com/ryhled/cached/tree/master/demo/) section**.


## Future plans

* Add support for distributed caching (IDistributedCache) and optimal probabalistic stampede prevention.
* Add support for cache warmup.
